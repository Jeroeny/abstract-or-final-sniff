# abstract-or-final-sniff

PHP CodeSniffer sniff to find classes not declared as abstract or final.

Install it with `composer require --dev matthewbdaly/abstract-or-final-sniff`.

I recommend using [phpcodesniffer-composer-installer](https://github.com/DealerDirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer) to manage it. Then it should be available as `AbstractOrFinalClassesOnly`.
